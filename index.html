        <p> Australia is home to some of the largest deposits of critical minerals that fuel technologies and modern economies. 
          From rare earth to energy minerals, Australiaâ€™s vast landscape provides the world with the raw materials that drive innovation. 
          essential for the functioning of our modern technologies, economies or national security. Understanding their
          distribution is beneficial for increasing Australi's global production potential.
          This visualization, explores the critical mines, production, exploration and and global trade that underline the economics of Australian Minerals.
          The map above outlines the critical mines and mineral deposits of Australia.

          Australia has witnessed a steady increase in mineral exploration expenditure 
          for all deposits, totalling to about $1 billion this year. Consequently, the 
          exploration expenditure for gold, iron ore, coal, base metals and others has also
          grown steadily over the past 7 years. In contrast, expenditure for coal has
          remained more or less the same over the years. Expenditure for gold was at an all time
          high between 2021 and 2023.

      <p class="pad">
        The country witnessed a drastic shift in the mineral market when it comes to
        statewise production. From 1860 to 1920, New South Wales accounted for about 
        80% of Australia's mineral production. However since then, for the last century, Victoria
         and Western Australia have been dominating the mineral market.

      <p>
        1851 - 1870 witnessed the Gold Rush in Australia. During this time, Australia accounted
         for one third of the world's gold production. This pivotal period is reflected in the chart.

          Exploration expenditure for existing and new deposits refers to the financial
          investment made to discover and assess mineral resources. There has been 
          consistent expenditure on exploration over the last 7 years. A total of around $1B
          has been spent on exploring all total deposits in 2024. Out of this, about $712M accounted 
          for exploring existing sites while  about $303M was spent on exploring new ones.

          This analysis
          is critical to strike a balance between enhancing capability and production 
          potential of existing deposits while also innovating an exploring for future needs.
